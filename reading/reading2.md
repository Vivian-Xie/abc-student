Do you find ancestors of the old web vernacular (that Lialina describes) in today's web design? 

Yes, I find the outer space backgrounds still popular today. Even for CSDN, Chinese Software Developer Network’s official website is still using the background with moving star tails today. Fashion and classics that attract humans in the past can still be fascinating nowadays. 

How would you describe the research that Lialina is doing? Why does she do it? What is the purpose of it? 

I think Lialina is observing people’s attitudes towards the world wide web by studying the important elements of the web. She write the trends down in her websites and the writings can be a faithful witness of the development of website programming technology. The most importantly, she is writing based on her love to the world wide web. While editing these pages, she is also enjoying a good time online, and designing her own platform. 

How does the vernacular Lialina describes compare with the web you grew up on / with? 

The vernacular I experienced is so well-developed that we can use only a few lines of code to do a lot of amazing things. Apart from that, the current web has more legal regulations than before and it is more commercialized, because the vernacular at that time were mostly made by amateur and the law system that regulate people’s online behavior is not so complete.
